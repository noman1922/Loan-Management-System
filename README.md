# Loan-Management-System
The Loan Management System, developed using PHP, HTML, and CSS, offers a streamlined solution for managing loans and payments. The system begins with the database setup, facilitated by the db_l (2).sql file, which provides the necessary schema and initial data.

For loan management, the system includes functionality to add new loan applications via insert.php, while view_loan_applications.php allows users to view submitted loan applications. The loan_status.php file is used to update and track the status of these applications.

In terms of payment management, the insert_payment.php file is used to record loan payments, and view_payments.php enables users to view payment details. Additionally, the system can generate invoices for payments through the print_invoice.php file.

The system also supports reporting and searching capabilities. The report.php file is utilized to generate and view reports related to loans and payments, while search.php enables users to search for specific loan applications, statuses, or payments.

The user interface design and layout are defined in the styles.css file, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. The index.php file likely serves as the homepage or dashboard, with view.php providing a generic view page for various entities. The system also includes miscellaneous resources such as x.jpg, which could be an image used within the interface.

Overall, this Loan Management System offers comprehensive features to efficiently manage loan processing, payment tracking, and reporting, providing a seamless experience for users.
